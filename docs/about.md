# About Agda-Material

This repository supports ==**generation of websites and PDFs**== with
==**highlighted code**== from (plain and/or literate) Agda source files.

Currently, Agda can generate a directory of highlighted, hyperlinked web pages
from a single (plain or literate) source file, including all imported modules.
But it is left to the user to incorporate the pages in a website.

Agda can also generate a LaTeX file for highlighting the source code of a single
(plain or literate) source file. But the user needs to generate LaTeX files for
imported modules individually, as well as provide a complete LaTeX document that
inputs the generated files.

Agda-Material automates the steps that Agda leaves to the user when generating
web pages and LaTeX files. After creating a repository from the Agda-Material
template and updating the Agda files (or copying the template files to an
existing repository), running the command `make website` generates a website
and a PDF with highlighted listings of all the files imported by a root  file.
