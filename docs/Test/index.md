# Test

!!! note

    The files listed at [Test2] and [Test3] are from
    [examples/syntax/highlighting] in the Agda repository.
    (The module `Test` is not imported to avoid errors due to duplicate bindings
    of builtins.)

    The pragmas for the old built-ins `NIL` and `_::_` have been commented-out
    to avoid warnings when loading them.
